# ml-library
A basic, minimal Machine Learning library developed in conjunction with coursework

This library enables the usage of basic MLP's, basic GNN's, CNN's, and provides some handy utilties for writing images, CSV files, and more.

Credit goes to our professor, Dr. Gashler, University of Arkansas for providing base code classes like Matrix.java and Vector.java, which were heavily modified.
